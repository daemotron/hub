Stormrose Hub Documentation
===========================

This documentation is primarily a source for developers contributing to The Stormrose Hub project and administrators
maintaining it. Furthermore, also rather specific roles such as division managers will find a certain level of coverage
by this documentation. However, this documentation does not cover general end user guidance.


How the documentation is organised
----------------------------------

* If you're a Stormrose Hub administrator, try the technical :doc:`Administrator's Guide <admin/index>` -- this
  might just be the documentation you're looking for.

* If you're a Stormrose Division Manager, Dispatcher, Fleet Manager, or assuming any other role linked to Stormrose's
  management, try the :doc:`Manager's Guide <manager/index>`.

* Looking for information on a specific application being part of the Stormrose Hub? Check out the
  :doc:`Application Section <applications/index>`, providing information on all applications written for the Hub.

* The :doc:`Project Documentation <internals/index>` will tell you about the development process, and how you can
  contribute.

* :doc:`Reference guides <ref/index>` contain technical reference for APIs and other aspects of the Stormrose Hub
  machinery. They describe how it works and how to use it but assume that you have `Python`_ and `Django`_ knowledge.
